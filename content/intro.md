# About

I am a solar physicist who studies how waves and flows shape the Sun, and how we can use them to probe regions we cannot observe directly.

My work treats oscillations, atmospheric waves, and small-scale motions as physical diagnostics, especially in magnetized and stratified plasma.

## Current Research

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at **Stanford University’s W. W. Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory**, where I work with **HMI/SDO** data to study large-scale solar dynamics.


My research focuses on:
- **Rossby and inertial modes in the solar interior**
- **Large-scale flows and their depth-dependent structure**
- **Connections between subsurface dynamics and surface observables**

I use helioseismic tools such as spherical harmonic analysis, time-distance methods, and frequency-domain diagnostics to connect observations across depth and height.

I am also a member of the Helioseismology Team and CET team for [**COFFIES**](https://coffies.stanford.edu/).
COFFIES is a [NASA DRIVE Science Center](https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/dsc/coffies/) that stands for *Consequences Of Fields and Flows in the Interior and Exterior of the Sun*.

## PhD

I earned my PhD from  **New Mexico State University** in August 2024. My dissertation was <img src="/dunn.jpg" alt="Dunn Solar Telescope"
     style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" width="250"> entitled *''Dynamics of the Solar Atmosphere Observed with the Dunn Solar Telescope''*. 


That work included:
- **Observational studies of atmospheric gravity waves in quiet-Sun and magnetized regions**
- **Using waves to probe magnetic structures throughout the solar atmosphere**
- **Identifying small-scale chromospheric swirls with narrowband Hα imaging**


My PhD work has results in three peer-reviewed publications to date.

## Research Motivation

*What ties all of my work together is an interest in connections.*

I am motivated by how different layers of the Sun communicate through waves and flows, and by building diagnostics that link the solar interior, photosphere, and chromosphere into a coherent physical picture.

## Outside of the Office

When I am not working, you can usually find me outside. I enjoy hiking, kayaking, climbing, and running, and I value time outdoors as a way to reset and stay grounded.
