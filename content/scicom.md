## Public outreach and science communication

Public engagement is an integral part of my scientific work. Much of my research focuses on dynamic processes in the Sun that connect fundamental plasma physics to phenomena with direct relevance for space weather and Earth’s space environment. Communicating this science clearly, accurately, and accessibly is essential for building public understanding of heliophysics and for supporting the broader scientific ecosystem that relies on public investment.

My outreach efforts emphasize connecting cutting-edge solar research to students, educators, and the general public, often through large-scale events such as solar eclipses, public talks, and interdisciplinary programs. I view outreach not as a separate activity, but as a complementary extension of research and mentorship, particularly for students and early-career scientists navigating scientific pathways.

## Eclipse-based outreach and community engagement

As a co-PI of the Nationwide Eclipse Ballooning Project (NEBP), I helped lead a national, multidisciplinary program that engaged students and the public in hands-on atmospheric and solar science during the 2023 and 2024 solar eclipses. This work combined research-grade instrumentation with public-facing demonstrations, community partnerships, and student mentorship, enabling participants to contribute meaningfully to data collection while learning how large collaborative science projects operate.

These eclipse-driven activities served as both scientific investigations and outreach platforms, providing accessible entry points into heliophysics, atmospheric science, and data analysis for diverse audiences.

## Commitment to inclusive science communication

I am particularly committed to outreach that lowers barriers to participation in science and demystifies research careers. As a first-generation college and graduate student, I benefited from mentorship and transparent guidance that made scientific pathways more navigable. This perspective shapes how I approach public communication, student engagement, and mentoring, with an emphasis on clarity, context, and inclusivity.

Through public talks, media engagement, and student-centered programs, I aim to present solar physics as both intellectually rigorous and broadly accessible, while highlighting the collaborative and human dimensions of scientific research.
