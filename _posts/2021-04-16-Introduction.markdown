I am an astronomy PhD student at New Mexico State University. My research is focused on exploring the behavior of the Solar atmosphere using waves and oscillations as seismic diagnostics to probe hard to observe/measure plasma properties. When I am not doing research, you can find me hiking, running, or rock climbing.
